Overview

This repository is a home for code related to fetching and generating embeddings for semantic document search and testing the effectiveness of the embeddings. It is designed to explore, develop, and evaluate methodologies for embedding-based semantic search systems, ensuring high-quality and efficient information retrieval.

Features

Embedding Generation: Tools and utilities for generating embeddings from various document types.

Semantic Search: Implementation of algorithms and frameworks for semantic document retrieval.

Effectiveness Testing: Scripts and methodologies to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of generated embeddings.

Extensibility: Designed to easily integrate with different embedding models and search engines.

Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
